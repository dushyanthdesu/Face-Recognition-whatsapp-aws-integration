# Face-Recognition-whatsapp-aws-integration

First I had collected the face images of two persons.
Then with the help of two datasets, I had trained two models.
Then based on upon the face it recognizes, this program either sends whatsapp message and mail or creates an ec2 instance, ebs volume and attaches that volume to the instance.
